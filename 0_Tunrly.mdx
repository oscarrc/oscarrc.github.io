## Tunrly, the only free music streaming app without ads

Tunrly was born as my graduation project for my web development studies. It was comprised of a client app in a form PWA and an API made with Express.

The API used LastFM and Musicbrainz APIs to fetch data for any artist, album or song available and, using web scrapping, the song was fetched from Youtube. To avoid rate limits all this data was "cached" to a MongoDB database.

The client app allowed the user to create and log in with his account to listen to any song. The user could also mark songs as favorites and create playlists.

The app was working flawesly although not so much people used it. This and the fact Heroku removed free-tier dynos (the API was hosted there) made me take down the app for the time being.
