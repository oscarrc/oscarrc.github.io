## Metaupload, a decentralized file sharing service

Made in one week, Metaupload is a proof of concept of a decentralized file sharing service based on IPFS.

It uses the Javascript implementation of IPFS to run a node on the browser and pin files which will be accessible by anyone with the full link (CID and encryption key) as long as the uploader is connected to the service.

It's made in React and it can be installed as a PWA.

As I've said this is nothing serious but a proof of concept.
