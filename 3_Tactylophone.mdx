## Tactylophone. A monophonic square wave syntheziser

Tactylophone is a simple monophonic syntheziser made using vanilla Javascript (no framework) and the Web Audio API. The instrument itself is an SVG with events attached to the relevant components.

It consist of an square wave oscilator and a vibrato effect made by connecting the main oscillator frequency to a second one to create the effect.

It can be used with mouse and keyboard or, more conveniently, in touch enabled devices which allows the user to change the tuning mode and enable/disable the vibrato effect while playing.

It's build as a PWA and packed as an Android TWA app using [Bubblewrap](/#/blog/1_PWA_to_TWA.mdx).
