## Why I made this

Well, Github pages is a great hosting for static pages, but I wanted to add content to my page on a regular basis, so I wanted something more dynamic than Jeckyl that's why I've decided to make a React app who fetches the content from mdx files stored in a Github repo. This way, adding content is as simple as commiting a new file to a repo, no re-builds and no re-deploys needed.


## How I've made it?

That was a pretty simple aproach. I've started with a CRA app and React Router, using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com) to quickstart the styling.

For the content, I use the [Github API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/contents) to fetch a list of files in the repo, sanitizing to only show mdx files. These files are then parsed with [@mdx/js](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx) in order to convert the markdown to a React component, and with the help of remark and rehype plugins I parse the frontmatter metadata. As simple as that!

~~~javascript
const parse = async (data) => {
    const evaluated = await evaluate(data, { 
        ...runtime, 
        remarkPlugins: [remarkFrontmatter, remarkMdxFrontmatter], 
        rehypePlugins: [[rehypeHighlight, {detect: true}]] 
    });
    return evaluated;
}

I hope you like this new version of my portfolio.
