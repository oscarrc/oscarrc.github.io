## Korg NTS-1 Web controller

The NTS-web is a web app that allows the user to easily control and edit the paramaters of his NTS-1.
It also allows to save and load patches, extending the functionality of the device above and beyond its defaults.
It makes use of the Web Midi API to communicate with the device and stores its settings on the browser's local storage for persistence.
It's build as a PWA, which allows me to pack the app as native for Windows, Linux and Android.
